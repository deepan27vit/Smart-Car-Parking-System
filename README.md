# Smart-Car-Parking-System

This project demonstrates a simple and efficient smart car parking system built using an Arduino UNO, IR sensors, a servo motor, and an LCD display. The system automatically tracks the availability of parking slots and controls the entry gate based on sensor feedback.

Two IR sensors are placed at the entry and exit points. When a vehicle is detected at the entry sensor and parking space is available, the gate opens automatically and the slot count decreases. Similarly, when a vehicle exits, the exit sensor updates the slot count and the gate opens to allow the car to move out. The updated number of available slots is shown in real time on the LCD display.

This setup provides a basic prototype of automated parking management, commonly used in malls, offices, and public parking areas. It helps reduce manpower and ensures smooth vehicle movement with automatic gate operation and live slot monitoring.
